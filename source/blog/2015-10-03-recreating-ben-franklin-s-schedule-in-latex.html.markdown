It may well be true that a thing of beauty is a joy forever.

Every self-help system and their legion of gurus has a complicated method overpromising fantastic results.  The success of the system depends on it being complicated, because a confused reader is a reader still searching for answers.  The simplicity of Franklin's schedule is what makes it a pleasure to use.  Nothing will make you feel like a robot in the morning quicker than a seventeen-point checklist timed down to the minute.

It's funny that it probably took me ten times as long to typeset this than it did him.  I struggled with the LaTeX.  The LaTeX file used to generate this schedule is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spicybits/daily-schedule).
